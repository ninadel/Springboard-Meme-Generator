# Springboard-Meme-Generator
A meme generator project from the Springboard Software Engineering Bootcamp
## Functionality
* Form takes image URL and text, which is then presented back as a meme where text is overlayed on image
* Multiple memes can be added to the page

## Limitations
* All meme text fields are required--would be better to have some flexibility here but this is required by the project requirements
* Currently no way to export meme as code or image
* Does not retain memes on page refresh
